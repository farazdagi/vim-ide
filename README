Note: This document assumes you have never installed or configured vim and that you are using Ubuntu. If you have already installed it please backup and rm your ~/.vim and ~/.vimrc file as it will be replaced by VIM-IDE.

sudo apt-get install vim-runtime vim-common vim-gui-common vim-tiny curl exuberant-ctags

Clone the GIT repo to your HOME directory and go there
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/farazdagi/vim-ide.git
cd /vim-ide

Get latest GIT Submodule dependencies
git submodule init
git submodule update

Create Symbolic Link to vim-ide so vim can find it
ln -s ~/vim-ide ~/.vim

Enjoy!
